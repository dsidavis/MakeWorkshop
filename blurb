Make, Shell scripting, Autoconf, CMake and Portability

This is smorgasbord of somewhat related topics. We’ll talk about
writing shell scripts to automate tasks and for use in Makefiles.
We’ll talk about Make - what it is used for, the essential ideas,
details of writing Makefiles for different projects.  We’ll also talk
about the role of autoconf and cmake and how these are used to create
portable projects and software.
